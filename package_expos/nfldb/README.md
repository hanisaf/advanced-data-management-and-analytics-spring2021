## Guide

nfldb is a relational database that provides command lines to pull from NFL game data (imported from nflgame) to be used for presentation or analysis. Data includes game schedules, score, rosters, play-by-play and more. There is one limitation with this package, which is that it is not Python 3 compatible. No worries, we will take you through the steps to allow it to work.

#### Installation

1. The first step is to install Python 2.7 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2716/)
2. The second step is to install a server and set up your database, thorough guides are found [here](https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/wiki/Installation)
