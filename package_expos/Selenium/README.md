## Guide

[Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) is suite of different tools with the purpose of automating web browsing. Many use Selenium for web-application testing and automation. Open source projects surround Selenium, and Selenium allows folks who are interested in helping the tool join their Developers Group.

In addition, Selenium offers several different tools that allow for web automation and testing:

- WebDriver: This is the one we will be focusing on in the demo. It drives a browser to mimic how a user might drive it on their own.
- IDE (Integrated Development Environment): This is a tool for test case environments.
- Grid: Allows for testing on multiple machines.

In our demo, we will be using one of their most common tools - [WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/). This tool will allow you to use Python to automate web browing and internet interactions.
