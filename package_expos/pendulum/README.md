# Pendulum Package
#### Group 28

## Overview
Pendulum is a Python package used to ease datetimes manipulation since Python's native datetime class can be quite difficult to work with if timezone manipulations are involved. The package is a drop-in replacement for the built-in datetime class. This means that Pendulum can be integrated in with Python projects that are already using the built-in datetime class.

The complex timezone problems are simplified by Pendulum's default of storing datetime values with timezones. Pendulum's defalut timezone is UTC format. UTC format is hour (based on a 24-hour clock), minute, second. Pendulum also has support for Daylight Savings Time. The package is also full of utility functions that make other datetime manipulations and formating easy. 

Install with `pip install pendulum`. If there is an issue try installing a specific version of pendulum.
