## Guide
-----------
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. 

Numpy operates arrays by adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions. 

NumPy used for working with arrays. It also has functions in domain of linear algebra,  fourier transform, and matrices. NumPy supports a wide range of hardware and computing platforms, and plays well with distributed, GPU, and sparse array libraries.

Ecosystem of NumPy:

- Scientific Domain 

- Array Libraries 

- Data Science

- Machine Learning 

- Visualization

To use NumPy in your own, use the following command:

"import numpy as np"
