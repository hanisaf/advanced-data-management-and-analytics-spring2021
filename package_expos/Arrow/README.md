## Guide

Arrow is a python library that offers an approach to creating, formatting, and manipulating dates and times that is user-friendly.

### Use cases and functionalities 

Python’s standard library and some other low-level modules have near-complete date, time and timezone functionality, but don’t work very well from a usability perspective:

- Too many modules: datetime, time, calendar
- Too many types
- Timezones and timestamp conversions are complicated and not user-friendly 

Some of the functionalities included in the package are: 

- UTC time (Universal Coordinated Time) 
    - helps to reduce confusion when people are comparing time zones and daylight savings time.
- Local time 
    - finding the exact time in a particular location 
- Format and parse strings automatically
- Extracting parts of a date (year, month, day, weekday)
- Timezone conversion
- Formatting dates and times 
- Humanizing dates and times
    - formats dates in a way that is easy to understand 
- Shift method
    - allows a user to shift a date or time 
- Generate time spans and ranges 


```python

```
